This package contains pre-release source code and is currently under restricted
distribution, pending the academic publication of my work.  Please follow these
rules regarding the use of the source code contained in this package:

If the date is before September 23, 2014:

1. Do not share this source code with anyone without clearing it with me first;

2. Do not publish any results obtained through the use of this source code.  If
   you still wish to publish results, please check with me, we may be able to
   come to an agreement.

If the date is September 23, 2014 or later:

    The restrictions are lifted.  If you plan to publish your work, please
    check to see if I have published my work in an academic journal yet.  If I
    have, I would request you cite me; if I have not, too bad for me, but you
    waited long enough, so feel free to publish without citation.
    
Thank-you!

Sincerely,
David L. F. Gaden
